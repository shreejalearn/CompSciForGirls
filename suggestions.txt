(1) index.html:
    (1) maybe remove the feature when mouse pointer hovers over the giant text as it's kind of distracting

    **(2) the laptop image hasn't loaded yet on my end (the image file isn't in the assets folder)

    **(3) add a feature where pressing the left and right keys can also do the rotation transition

    **(4) keep the nav bar in the same location as when viewed in the other files


** overall it looks amazing! all of these suggestions don't have to be implemented as it depends on personal preferences 

** i also think the website looks pretty good even without the suggestions :)
